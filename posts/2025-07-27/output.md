# Fixing Absurd Syntax Errors

I wanted to watch [Typst](https://typst.app/) rebuild my résumé every second—because nothing says “productivity” like real‑time CV tweaking. My totally flawless `zsh` one‑liner:

```zsh
while true; do typst compile resume.typ source/resume.pdf || true; do typst compile --input redacted=true resume.typ source/resume-redacted.pdf || true; sleep 1; done
```

`zsh`, ever the purist, replied:

```
zsh: parse error near `do'
```

Five minutes of self‑delusion later—after searching the exact message on [Kagi](https://kagi.com/) and deciding the shell was clearly at fault—I pasted the line into ChatGPT. The LLM immediately spotted the extra `do` masquerading as punctuation and handed me a sane loop:

```zsh
while true; do
  typst compile resume.typ source/resume.pdf || true
  typst compile --input redacted=true resume.typ source/resume-redacted.pdf || true
  sleep 1
done
```

Yes, it was that obvious. No, I didn’t see it.
